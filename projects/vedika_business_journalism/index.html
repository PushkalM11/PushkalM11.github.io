                        SONIPAT, May 4 – It has been around five decades since India produced a globally recognized champion such as Vijay Amritraj back in the 1970s. Though the country has seen talents like Mirza, Paes, Bopanna, none have come near to the elite status which Amritraj once held.

                        India and tennis may not be two words one would automatically put together. Like most other sports, it has to vie for attention in cricket-obsessed India. There is a long list of reasons to answer why Indians go to Europe or the States to turn pro.

                        Firstly, the infrastructure of the sport is not great. Majority of the courts belong to exclusive, hence expensive clubs; and the others aren’t worth being played on. Secondly, in order to recurrently play singles at the highest level, having a support team is of the highest priority. A team that looks after the player’s mental and physical fitness helps improve their overall performance. Tennis being an individual sport, needs a supportive team for the player to stay on top of their game. Thirdly, being on tour and other expenses are costly in the world of tennis. Government or private funding is sporadic for tennis players. They hardly get enough backing to satisfy needs on the circuit. Lastly, there aren't enough professional tournaments being held in India. Due to this, several Indian players miss out on getting enough match practice and the sport is not promoted in the way it should be.
                        <br><br>
                        There are several such reasons because of which players look to travel abroad and get sponsored by academies outside or engage in training programs with them. Why would the head coach of a well-established academy in the tennis hub of Spain –Barcelona, hit Indian clay? "India has great potential and talent but lacks facilities and a vision", said Walter Grunfeld, Director of WGTA, Begues. Grunfeld has both, hosted and attended many tennis camps in India and is aware of the talent and facilities available here.

                        In India, academies have mushroomed as purely business hubs and not training academies with a vision. Though their coaching teams might be impressive, comprising of former international and national players, their outlook remains the same. The reason for Indian players’ persistent fitness issues is a lack of fundamental training at an early age. These academies treat young players as mere sources of revenue generation and only pay attention to their top athletes. Academies take advantage of the disposable income that middle class Indians have, and provide only mediocre training to players.
                        <br><br>
                        Every tennis parent dreams of Grand Slam success for their child, but most don’t end up achieving that. This is far less because of talent, than it is about the right facilities and atmosphere around a player. The Indian branch of WGTA will offer a similar set of programs like its parent academy in Barcelona does.

                        In order to harness the players' best, the academy has divided their programs according to the expertise of the player and the number of hours they can dedicate. Each player will be given individual attention and the player-to-coach ratio will never increase from 2:1. Coaching sessions will also be designed such that each player achieves their individual goals in the least possible time. On any average day, a professional player will play for around 5-7 hours; inclusive of on-court training and fitness or yoga sessions.<br><br>

                       In this manner, the academy will combine the latest technology along with age-old traditional forms of coaching. The additional aspect that puts WGTA above its contemporaries is its coaches’ training program. This is a specially designed program for coaches in the Indian subcontinent that have a rigid outlook towards the manner in which coaching sessions are conducted. The biggest problem arises with the excess of focus being given to the skills of the sport itself. Training is rarely paired adequately with psychological and tactical classes and advanced fitness training.
                       <br><br>
                       While current sponsors for the parent academy include TenX, Mush and Solinco, Grunfeld is already in the talks with Yonex and Decathlon for sponsorship in India. “Balancing out cost invested for infrastructure and that earned in the very early months may prove to be a big challenge”, said Grunfeld. Since the aim of the academy lies in bringing this multifaceted approach to training under one roof, the Director wishes to buy an already-existing academy with five to six synthetic courts. He has identified certain academies in both Delhi and Gurgaon and is on the final leg of the decision-making. Current quotation for academy land for lease is around fifty thousand per month. His major investment shall lie in adding changing rooms and bathrooms with shower facility. Around seventy-five thousand will be spent per month on the boarding and lodging of both players and coaches. Apart from that, other investments would include partnership with a club for their pool and gym facility.

                        The ballpark figure for running an academy in the NCR comes to about fifty-four lakhs per annum. While his savings allow him to run the academy for five to seven months, he would need sponsors or partners post this short run.

                        The biggest challenge still lies in convincing parents that put academics in the forefront and sport at the background. While they have big dreams, the moment the child reaches high school, they shift focus to academics and make the child choose between the two. If not, the child is expected to perform good at tests in school while simultaneously excelling at the sport. This puts immense pressure on the minds and bodies of the children and prevents them from tapping their potential in either of the fields. The aim of this venture is to make this a world class tennis academy that produces champions and brings laurels to the country. Grunfeld said, "This academy is more than a project for me. It is a dream that I’m putting my life’s work into."

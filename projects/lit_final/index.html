                        The stream of photographs below narrates a story about the life of soldiers involved in the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission (MONUC) in Congo. The photos are also accompanied by some quotes from my father, who was posted at the heart of the conflict in 2006-2007.

                        "It wasn't us, but the rebel army that was killing people. There were some collateral casualties and deaths in cross-firing, but that was always in the larger interestâ€”never intentional. In my 13 months at Congo, there was not even once instance when the local civilians were harmed for the cause of the UN Peacekeepers."

                        "In order to obey the orders of senior UN officials, we sometimes had to open fire on the rebel army (who were also civilians) against our wishes. But that is how we're trained. We have to follow orders, irrespective of our personal opinions, come what may."

                        "Most of us at the UN camp had our own views of the political situation. But we only discussed them at informal meetings. Having our own views didn't mean we could follow them. As a part of a professional force, a soldier has to follow orders for the larger cause."

                        "We used to go for scheduled routine walks on the air-strip. The rebels used to hide in the corner waiting for us, and open fire on us. Human rights violations is a relative term. What about the human rights of the soldiers and the common people that they were taking away?"

It is not possible for any fighting force in the world to ensure that there is absolutely zero collateral in preventing organized violence. If some civilians are killed, yes, it is violation of human rights. But it is impossible to eliminate that."

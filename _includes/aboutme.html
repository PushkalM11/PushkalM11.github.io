<p>
I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, where I have worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2WvQ1ZsAAAAJ&hl=en">Srinivasan Iyengar</a>, <a href="https://mohitjaindr.github.io/">Mohit Jain</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/swmanohmicrosoft-com/">Manohar Swaminathan</a>.

<h5>Research Interests</h5>
<p>
    I work broadly in the intersection of <b>HCI, sensing, and applied AI/ML</b>. Specifically, I like to build systems that employ sensing, algorithms, AI/ML to explore HCI questions. Application areas of my interest are <b>health, ICTD, education, sustainability, and sports</b>. My work has been published at CSCW, ACM COMPASS (<span class="text-my-blue">Best Paper Award</span>), and ACM SenSys (poster). Some of my work is also open sourced by Microsoft: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/modulo">github.com/microsoft/modulo</a>.

<h5>Past Life :)</h5>
<p class="m-0">
    Prior to MSR, I graduated with honours (major CGPA: 3.98) in Computer Science from <a href="http://ashoka.edu.in">Ashoka University</a>, India. At Ashoka, I was awarded the Undergraduate Research Excellence award. I also won the Student Life Excellence award for my contributions to student life and social impact. I have represented Ashoka in badminton, football, and tennis (which I've played at a national level).

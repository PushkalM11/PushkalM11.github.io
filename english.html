					Introduction
				</h3>
				<p class="lead text-justify">

					<ul class="lead text-justify">
						<li>
							Improving fluency through regular practice and speaking drills
						</li>
						<li>
							Expanding vocabulary by at least 300 words through assignments and class work
						</li>
						<li>
							Developing a solid understanding of basic grammar structures&mdash;like nouns, verbs and adjectives—through reading, writing, listening and speaking tasks in the class
						</li>
					</ul>

					Methodology
				</h3>
				<p class="lead text-justify">
					Our class will use a variety of learning techniques. These include pair work, discussions, storytelling and individual assignments that use the text book and other materials provided by the teacher. In class, students will work, learn and speak together. This is not a lecture class where the students sit quietly and listen. They are actively involved in a highly interactive class.
